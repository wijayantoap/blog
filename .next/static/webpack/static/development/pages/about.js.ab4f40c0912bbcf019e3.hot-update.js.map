I graduated from a university called Asia Pacific University, located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. And yes, I know there's another university called APU which is located in Japan but it is a whole different university and unfortunately doesn't have any relation at all. \nAs I mentioned earlier, I am currently working as a developer, I do enjoy coding (if everything is working), solving problems (that I create), dealing with people Krappa and probably things that you are currently thinking.\nOh yeah, here's my linked in if you are interested to find out more about my background.\nAnyhow, lately I have been interested in this thing called UI, design or whatever you may call. So I might gonna be implementing some of my weird design in here and there. So you might or not want to check it out later.\nFiuh, I know it's very brief. But it is already morning now, I'll update whatever I want to write here later on. So for now, this is what it is.\nIf you have anything you want to share, somehow want to ask for help for university assignment or whatsoever, you can contact me at wijayanto.a.p@gmail.com.\n\n\n          </Content>\n        </section>\n      </main>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default AboutPage\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;;;;;;;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAcA;;;;AAvBA;AACA;AAyBA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
